              <p className="mb-3">Prostate cancer is the most prevalent malignancy among men in the Western world, and with ongoing demographic shifts, its incidence is expected to rise in the coming years. Despite advancements, optimal treatment strategies for prostate cancer remain uncertain in various clinical scenarios. To address this, the Co-IMPACT consortium was established by a global, multidisciplinary team of experts in radiotherapy, nuclear medicine, and medical oncology. Comprising 45 centers across Europe, the USA, Asia, and Australia, the consortium is dedicated to advancing prostate cancer care.</p>
              <p className="mb-3">Through four sub-projects (Co-IMPACT1-4), the consortium will investigate specific clinical scenarios along the prostate cancer patient pathway. The aim is to define personalized treatment approaches and, using advanced medical imaging such as PSMA-PET/CT, improve outcomes for patients with prostate cancer.</p>
              <p>This SOP defines the roles, the responsibilities of the consortiums principal investigators as well as the procedures ensuring a smooth operation.</p>
